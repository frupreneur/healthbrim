  <p style="text-align:center;">Breast cancer can begin in different parts of the breast. A breast is made up of three main parts: lobules, ducts, and connective tissue. The lobules are the glands that produce milk. The ducts are tubes that carry milk to the nipple. The connective tissue (which consists of fibrous and fatty tissue) surrounds and holds everything together. Most breast cancers begin in the ducts or lobules. Breast cancer can spread outside the breast through blood vessels and lymph vessels. When breast cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it is said to have metastasized. Do you have any of the below symptoms?</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center">Breast Cancer Emotional concerns</h2>
    
    <p style="text-align:center; padding: 1rem;"> Most people with secondary breast cancer find their mood is affected by many things. Symptoms of the cancer, side effects from treatment, thoughts about the future, issues at home or the impact of the disease on relationships can all have an effect.

      Feelings of sadness and loss are common. Suddenly you’re facing an uncertain future and your life plans and goals have changed.
      
      People around you may encourage you to be positive and to ‘fight’ the cancer. For some people, adopting a ‘fighting spirit’ enables them to cope with their diagnosis. But it’s hard to be positive all the time and pressure from other people can sometimes make you feel inadequate and guilty.
      
      For many people, the uncertainty of living with secondary breast cancer can be the hardest part.
      
      Some people find living in the present and making plans from day to day easier than looking ahead. Others find that planning for the future helps them to feel more in control.
      
      With the right information and support, many people feel more confident about how to cope and make decisions about their care and treatment.
